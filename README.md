## Project Planning

- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
  - WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    - THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
  - WHEN prompted for password criteria
    - THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
  - WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    - THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
  - WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
    - THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
  - WHEN I answer each prompt
    - THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
  - WHEN all prompts are answered
    - THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
  - WHEN the password is generated
    - THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
